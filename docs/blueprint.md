- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, giving a modern, digital feel, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability and a neutral tone for factual information.
- Use clear and concise icons to represent different categories of civic issues.
- Implement a card-based layout similar to Reddit for displaying issues in an organized manner.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading content and interacting with elements.
